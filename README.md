# CI/CD Demo Project

This is a simple Node.js application demonstrating a full CI/CD pipeline. It uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) to automate testing and Vercel for Continuous Deployment (CD) to deploy the app live. The app displays a "Hello, World!" message and serves as a hands-on example of modern DevOps practices.

## Features
- **Node.js + Express:** A lightweight web server.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests with Jest and Supertest.
- **CI Pipeline:** GitHub Actions runs tests on every push or pull request.
- **CD Pipeline:** Vercel auto-deploys the app on every push to the `main` branch.
